Introduction to G-OnRamp Walkthrough
====================================

Introduction
------------

The overall goal of this walkthrough is to illustrate the use of the G-OnRamp workflow to create a genome browser. The walkthrough will cover topics including how to create an account and login, how to import the G-OnRamp workflow into your workspace, how to modify the workflow by changing tool parameters and adding new tools, and how to run the workflow. This walkthrough assumes that the reader has some basic familiarity with Galaxy. (See the “Overview of Galaxy” presentation for a detailed introduction to Galaxy).
